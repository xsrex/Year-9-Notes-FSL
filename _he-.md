## Protein

Protein is an important macronutrient. The building blocks of proteins are called **amino acids**. Each protein is made up of a unique combination of these.

### Functions
- Repair of body tissues, muscles and blood cells.
- Growth of body tissues, muscles and blood cells.
- Maintenance of the body
- Energy (secondary source and should not be regularly used)
### Sources
#### Animal
- Meat + poultry
- Fish
- Eggs
- Dairy products
#### Plant
- Pulses ( peas, beans, lentils )
- Rice
- Cereals
- Nuts
- Seeds

### Loss of demand of animal protein sources
- Animal foods are more expensive
- Animal foods contain high fat
- Salmonella / BSE scares
- More people are becoming vegetarian
- Animal foods contain saturated fat

### Alternatives
- Tivall (wheat + veg. prot.)
- Textured veg. prot. (soya)
- Quorn (mycoprotein (mushroom related))
- Tofu and Bean curd (soya)

### HBV + LBV
Protein sources can be classified as **high biological value** or **low biological value** depending on their amino acids:

|HBV sources|LBV sources|
|:-|:-|
|Chicken|Beans|
|Beef|peas|
|Pork|lentils|
|eggs|nuts|
|milk|seeds
|cheese| - |
|yoghurt| - |
|soya beans| - |
|quinoa| - |

Plant sources of protein do not contain sufficient levels of one or more of the amino acids required by humans.

We can overcome this problem by taking a mixture of proteins from plant foods together. They complement each other by supplying the full range of essential amino acids.

## Fat

### Functions
 - Supplies energy
 - Helps insulate the body
 - Protects major organs e.g. heart kidney
 - Makes all body cells
 - Provides fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K
 - Provides essential fatty acids
### Type of fat
Saturated - Solid at room temp.
### Sources of fat - saturated
### sources of fat - unsaturated
