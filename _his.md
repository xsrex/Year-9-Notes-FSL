# The Spanish Armada

## Background

During the Tudor period, Spain was the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world. It possessed an enormous army, and Spanish ships transported vast fortunes in gold from newly discovered territories back to Spain. In 1588, Spain's King Phillip I directed his country's resources toward a single objective: the invasion of England. He commissioned every shipyard in Spain to construct what many described as the greatest navy—or Armada—ever created. This massive fleet of 130 large warships was destined for England.

## Causes of Spanish-English Conflict

### Reasons for King Phillip's Animosity Toward Elizabeth I

- In April 1587, Sir Francis Drake, England's most renowned explorer, sailed into Cadiz harbor and destroyed 30 of Spain's royal warships
- English sailors had been routinely plundering gold and silver from Spanish ships at sea for years
- When Phillip (a Catholic) learned that Elizabeth had executed Mary Queen of Scots (also Catholic), he believed Elizabeth deserved punishment
- The Spanish Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) was under Spanish control, but recent revolts against Spanish rule had received English support
- Phillip had previously been married to Mary Tudor (known as "Bloody Mary," Elizabeth's half-sister), and after her death, he proposed marriage to Elizabeth, who rejected him—publicly embarrassing Phillip

### Historical Context

It appears Phillip had multiple substantial grievances against England. The destruction of his royal fleet was particularly significant, as was England's interference in Spanish territories and Elizabeth's execution of a Catholic monarch.

### Strategic Implications

Following any successful invasion, Phillip would likely attempt to restore Catholicism in England, given his strong Catholic beliefs and opposition to Elizabeth's Protestant rule.

### Overview
By the summer of 1588, King Phillip had assembled one of history's greatest naval fleets. The Spanish Armada consisted of 130 galleon ships painted in red and gold, covering approximately 12 square kilometers at sea as they headed toward England. Their strategy involved meeting with 20,000 ground troops at Calais in northern France before crossing the English Channel to depose Elizabeth and install Phillip as England's ruler.

### Naval Forces Comparison

#### Spanish Forces: "The Ropers and Raiders"
- **Ships**: 130 galleons
- **Ship Length**: Approximately 50 meters
- **Mobility**: Clumsy to steer
- **Sailors**: Numerous experienced sailors
- **Weapons**: Heavy guns for close combat
- **Commander Ability**: Less experienced naval commanders

Spanish galleons functioned like enormous floating castles but were difficult to maneuver. Their battle strategy relied on sailing alongside enemy vessels and securing them with ropes and hooks. Spanish soldiers would then board the enemy ships to engage in close combat using swords, daggers, and muskets. Below deck, heavy guns positioned near the enemy ships would blast holes in their hulls.

#### English Forces: "The Speedy Smashers"
- **Ships**: Approximately 130 ships, with only 60 combat-ready
- **Ship Length**: Approximately 25 meters (half the Spanish length)
- **Mobility**: Much quicker
- **Sailors**: Highly experienced naval crews
- **Weapons**: Superior long-range artillery
- **Commander Ability**: Highly skilled naval commanders

The English vessels, though smaller, had superior maneuverability. They possessed two critical advantages: exceptionally accurate long-range artillery and standardized cannonball sizes across their fleet. The Spanish ships utilized various gun sizes and types, creating logistical challenges during battle.

### Battle Strategies

The English planned to maintain a distance of 150 meters from Spanish ships, leveraging their superior artillery to fire 20kg cannonballs through enemy vessel hulls. Smaller "man killer" cannons would then target sailors with 8kg projectiles. Once Spanish ships were damaged and their crews weakened, English forces would board to complete the victory.

### Strategic Assessment

The English naval strategy appeared better suited to exploit their advantages in mobility and weaponry. Their standardized ammunition system offered operational efficiency while their superior maneuverability allowed them to dictate engagement terms. The Spanish approach required close-quarter combat that depended on successfully approaching and boarding English vessels—a challenging prospect given their mobility disadvantage.

### The Battle Unfolds

1. The Spanish Armada sailed in a defensive crescent formation designed to resist English attacks
2. On July 29, the Armada was spotted off Cornwall, prompting warning beacons across hilltops to alert the population about the potential invasion
3. The English Navy pursued the Spanish fleet for over a week but initially failed to sink any Spanish vessels
4. By August 6, the Spanish had reached Calais, France, where they awaited their ground troops, who were delayed
5. Sir Francis Drake deployed fireships—old vessels filled with straw, gunpowder, tar, and barrels of pig fat set ablaze—against the Spanish fleet
6. Panicked by the fireships, the Spanish formation scattered across the North Sea, leaving individual ships vulnerable to repeated English attacks
7. The Spanish attempted to flee but encountered a violent storm while navigating around Scotland and Ireland

### Aftermath

Nearly every Spanish ship sustained damage during their retreat. Sailors faced starvation as provisions spoiled, and wounded men succumbed to infections. Those who managed to reach Scottish or Irish shores often faced hostile locals.

### Queen Elizabeth's Leadership

During this crisis, Queen Elizabeth I delivered one of Britain's most memorable speeches to her troops on August 18, 1588. Dressed in white and silver and mounted on a white horse, she declared: "I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and a King of England too, and think foul scorn that... Spain... should dare invade the border of my realm."

### Reasons for English Success

- Leadership from Sir Francis Drake
- Faster English ships
- The skill of English men
- Sleeker ships
- Greater skill of commanders
- Use of fireships caused panic
- Prior warning from spies
- More well thought out tactics
- Weather conditionx favoured the English
### Reasons for Spanish Failure

Several factors contributed to the Armada's defeat:
- Delayed Spanish ground forces undermined the invasion plan
- Inferior ship mobility compared to English vessels
- Tactical errors including breaking formation when confronted with fireships
- Lack of contingency plans when the original strategy failed
- Severe weather conditions during the retreat

## Source Work Practice - The Spanish Armada (14 marks)

### Primary Sources

#### Source A - King Philip II, talking to survivors of the Armada (1588)
"I sent you to fight with men, and not the weather. What happened in the English Channel is a disgrace to Spain, but we will have our revenge against that barbaric and godless nation. Elizabeth's forces are no match for our great Armada. Her reign shall be no more."

#### Source B - Inscription on the Armada medal issued by Elizabeth I (1588)
"God blew with His wind, and they were scattered."

### Source Analysis Questions

#### Question 1: Source A Analysis
Philip II blamed the defeat of the Armada on the weather and expressed disappointment with his men's performance.

#### Question 2: Source Connection
Both sources reference weather as a factor in the Armada's defeat and make religious references, with each side claiming divine favor.

#### Question 3: Religious Significance
Religion played a crucial role in the Spanish Armada conflict. Source A shows Philip II referring to England as a "godless nation," while Source B attributes the Spanish defeat to divine intervention with "God blew with His wind." Beyond these sources, religious tensions formed the foundation of the conflict. Philip, a devout Catholic, considered it his duty to restore Catholicism to Protestant England. Elizabeth's execution of Mary Queen of Scots, a Catholic, further inflamed religious hostilities. Both sides viewed the battle not merely as a military conflict but as a divine judgment on their respective faiths.

#### Question 4: Source A Usefulness Analysis (MADCL Technique)

##### Mode
The source is a conversation between King Philip II and Armada survivors, making it valuable as a direct exchange between the Spanish monarch and participants in the event.

##### Author
King Philip II of Spain ordered the attack on England, giving him significant authority on the Spanish perspective, though his position also introduces bias.

##### Date
Created in 1588 shortly after the Armada's defeat, the source provides contemporary reactions to the event.

##### Content
The source reveals Philip's attribution of blame ("I sent you to fight with men, not the weather"), his animosity toward England ("barbaric and godless nation"), and his continued hostility ("we will have our revenge").

##### Limitations
The source presents only the Spanish perspective and shows clear bias against England. Philip II wasn't personally present during the battle, limiting his firsthand knowledge of events.

#### Conclusion on Source Usefulness
Source A provides valuable insight into the Spanish monarchy's official reaction to the defeat and reveals the continuing hostility toward England. While limited by Philip's bias and absence from the actual battle, it remains a useful primary source for understanding Spanish perspectives on the Armada's failure and the religious dimensions of the conflict.

# Unit 4a - The gunpowder plot

## The Scruffy Stuart

### The End of the Tudor Era

In 1603, Queen Elizabeth I became seriously ill with pneumonia. Despite her illness, she refused to rest properly and insisted on standing upright for 15 hours to demonstrate her strength. Eventually, she became unable to eat or speak, spending her days and nights lying on cushions and staring at the fire.

After reigning for 44 years without a husband or children, Elizabeth's advisors grew concerned about succession. When they suggested her third cousin, King James VI of Scotland, as her successor, the dying queen simply raised her hand and nodded in agreement.

The following morning, a messenger galloped to Scotland to inform James VI of the news. Weeks later, he arrived in London—tired, dirty, and injured from a fall during his journey—and became James I of England. This transition marked a profound change in the English monarchy as the Tudor era ended and the Scottish Stuart era began.

### James I: Fact File

- **Name**: James Stuart, Queen Elizabeth's third cousin
- **Age**: 36
- **Titles**: King James I of England and King James VI of Scotland
- **Early Career**: 
  - Successfully controlled powerful Scottish lords and highland chiefs
  - Divided Scotland into districts with appointed royal judges
  - Invited foreign weavers to improve Scottish textile industry
  - Encouraged mining of gold, silver, and coal
  - Maintained control of the Scottish (Protestant) Church
- **Intelligence**: Wrote several books, particularly on witchcraft and the dangers of tobacco
- **Royal Philosophy**: Believed in the "Divine Right of Kings"—that God had chosen him as monarch and he could do no wrong
- **Personal Habits**: 
  - Wore padded clothes for protection
  - Rarely changed damaged clothing, preferring to layer new items over old
  - Poor hygiene—never washed, used sleeves as handkerchiefs
  - Known for swearing and picking his nose
- **Historical Assessment**: Sir Anthony Weldon reportedly wrote in 1625 that James was "crafty and cunning in small things... but a fool in important matters"

### Religious Tensions

James recognized that religion would be a significant challenge, as it had been for English monarchs for decades. Despite Elizabeth's "middle way" compromise, religious conflicts persisted. Some Protestants left England after meeting James, while Catholics grew angry when he ordered their "troublesome priests" to leave the country. This religious tension would eventually lead to one of history's most infamous assassination attempts—the Gunpowder Plot.

### Succession Questions

The succession of James raised several important questions:

- Why was the King of Scotland asked to take over after Queen Elizabeth's death?
  - James was blood-related to Elizabeth as her third cousin and had demonstrated effective governance in Scotland.

- The accuracy of royal portraits was often questionable, as kings might have instructed artists to portray them more favorably than reality.

- The "Divine Right of Kings" was a political and religious doctrine asserting that monarchs derived their authority directly from God. This concept was particularly appealing to James I as it reinforced his authority and suggested his decisions could not be questioned.

### James and Parliament

James quickly styled himself as King of Great Britain, though England and Scotland continued to operate independently. In 1606, he established the first Union Flag, combining elements from both countries.

At Hampton Court Palace in 1604, James met with Church leaders and commissioned a new English translation of the Bible. The King James Bible remained unchanged for 300 years and became history's most printed book.

Though James needed Parliament to help govern England, he resisted their attempts to question his authority. Their relationship deteriorated significantly, and when Parliament refused to collect taxes for him, James dismissed them for ten years. He raised money through alternative means—selling land and titles—but his excessive spending left England nearly bankrupt by his death in 1625.

#### Parliament's Resistance to Divine Right

Parliament had several reasons to oppose the Divine Right of Kings:
- The doctrine prevented questioning of the king's intentions
- It undermined Parliament's legislative authority
- It disrupted the balance of power between monarchy and legislature

#### The King James Bible

The creation of a new Bible translation was politically significant for James I. By commissioning his own translation, the king:
- Created a lasting legacy
- Established religious authority
- Ensured consistent religious interpretation across the kingdom
- Reinforced his image as a learned and pious ruler

### The Gunpowder Plot

On November 5, 1605, one of English history's most significant events occurred—a failed revolution that continues to be commemorated more than 400 years later. This dramatic episode featured a plot to assassinate the king using gunpowder, followed by betrayal, imprisonment, torture, and executions.

#### Motivations

In 1605, King James enacted laws against Catholics, even ordering extremist priests to leave England or face execution. A small group of Catholic zealots (Jesuits) decided to assassinate the king, hoping his successor would treat Catholics more favorably. They planned to strike on November 5, the opening day of Parliament, when the king and most powerful figures in England would be gathered at Westminster.

#### The Conspirators

The plot was led by Robert Catesby, described as brave and handsome but having gambled away much of his family fortune. His co-conspirators included Tom and Robert Winter, Christopher and John Wright, Thomas Percy, and Guy (Guido) Fawkes—an experienced soldier skilled with explosives who would be responsible for igniting the gunpowder placed beneath Parliament.

After the planned explosion, the conspirators intended to capture James's young daughter Elizabeth and install her as a puppet monarch under Catholic guidance.

#### Analysis of the Plot

The plotters hoped to assassinate King James I and replace him with his daughter Elizabeth, whom they planned to influence toward Catholicism. However, their chances of success were slim:
- The plan lacked sophistication and careful coordination
- It would likely provoke significant public anger
- Even if successful in the assassination, securing Elizabeth and establishing Catholic control would have been extraordinarily difficult

Had the plot succeeded, Elizabeth's position would have been precarious:
- Catholic lords might attempt to force her conversion
- Protestants would resist a Catholic monarch or any perceived Catholic influence
- The young queen would be caught between competing religious factions

#### Historical Context

The Gunpowder Plot represented the culmination of religious tensions that had been building throughout the Tudor period. The illustration of the plotters (Source A) is noted to be likely inaccurate, as the artist probably never saw the actual conspirators. This reminds us that much of our historical understanding comes through potentially biased or incomplete representations.

## Official Account of the Plot

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed attempt to assassinate King James I by blowing up the Houses of Parliament.

### The Warning Letter

A mysterious letter arrived at Lord Monteagle's house approximately one week before Parliament's opening. It contained this warning:

> "I would advise you... to devise some excuse to shift your attendance at the Parliament... they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament and yet they shall not see who hurts them..."

Lord Monteagle, suspicious of the letter's contents, immediately delivered it to Robert Cecil, one of King James' advisors.

### The Discovery

- On November 5th, Cecil ordered a search of the cellars beneath Parliament
- Guards discovered a tall, brown-haired man carrying a lantern, matches, and a tinderbox
- The man claimed to be John Johnson, employed by Thomas Percy (who had rented the cellars)
- When brought before King James, he refused to answer questions
- The King ordered him imprisoned in the Tower of London and tortured
- After two days of torture, he revealed his true identity: Guido Fawkes
- Following eight additional days of torture, Fawkes confessed his intention to kill the King and named his co-conspirators

### The Other Plotters

When the remaining conspirators realized their plan had failed, they:
- Barricaded themselves in Holbeche House near Dudley in the Midlands
- Attempted to dry wet gunpowder near a fire, causing an explosion
- The noise alerted nearby royal troops
- During the ensuing confrontation, Catesby and Percy were killed by the same bullet
- Surviving plotters were arrested and transported to London

### The Punishment

The convicted plotters faced severe punishment:
- After a brief trial, they were sentenced to death
- They were dragged through London streets
- Partially hanged until nearly dead
- Cut down while still alive
- Disemboweled with their organs burned before their eyes
- Their corpses were dismembered and displayed throughout the country

Guy Fawkes likely died before his full punishment began. As he climbed the scaffold with the noose around his neck, he jumped headfirst, breaking his neck. The execution proceeded regardless.

## Historical Controversy: Were the Plotters Framed?

For centuries, most people accepted the government's official account of the Gunpowder Plot. However, some historians have questioned this narrative, arguing that Robert Cecil (a Protestant) knew about the plot in advance and possibly encouraged it to discredit Catholics.

### Evidence Supporting the "Framed" Theory

- **Evidence A**: The 36 barrels of gunpowder were stored in a cellar adjacent to Parliament. Thomas Percy rented this cellar through John Whynniard, a friend of Robert Cecil. Whynniard died suddenly and unexpectedly on the morning of November 5th.

- **Evidence B**: All gunpowder supplies were kept under guard in the Tower of London. The records for 1604 are missing.

- **Evidence C**: Lord Monteagle delivered the warning letter to Robert Cecil on October 26th. The cellars beneath Parliament weren't searched until at least a week later.

- **Evidence D**: According to a Catholic visitor to London in 1604, Robert Cecil stated: "The king is too kind to Catholics. This gives great offence to others. We cannot hope for good government while we have a large number of people who obey foreign rulers as Catholics do. The Catholic priests preach that Catholics must even kill the king to help their religion."

- **Evidence E**: Guy Fawkes' signatures while imprisoned in the Tower of London show dramatic differences. One was written shortly after his arrest, while the other was produced a few days later, suggesting potential coercion through torture.

- **Evidence F**: Thomas Winter's confession, read at the trial, exists only as a copy written by Robert Cecil himself. The original confession has never been located.

- **Evidence G**: Francis Tresham, one of the plotters and Lord Monteagle's brother-in-law, wasn't immediately captured. He was arrested on November 12th and died of a mysterious illness on December 22nd while imprisoned in the Tower of London. Some speculated he was poisoned.

- **Evidence H**: Holbeche House was surrounded on November 7th, merely two days after Fawkes' capture. According to government reports, it took two days of torture for Fawkes to reveal his real name, another two days to confess his role in the plot, and six more days to name his co-conspirators. This timeline presents inconsistencies.

## Historical Analysis

Historians remain divided regarding whether the Gunpowder Plotters were framed. Some interpret the evidence as proof that Robert Cecil knew about the plot from the beginning, while others maintain that the evidence is inconclusive. This historiographical debate exemplifies why studying history is fascinating—we can never be completely certain about past events, particularly when evidence might have been manipulated.

### Points to Consider

- Cecil's connections to the cellar where the gunpowder was stored raise questions about his potential foreknowledge
- The missing gunpowder records from 1604 could indicate deliberate record tampering
- Cecil's delay in ordering searches after receiving the warning letter suggests possible strategic timing
- His documented anti-Catholic sentiments provide potential motivation for framing Catholics
- The suspicious timing of arrests and questionable confessions merit critical examination
- The deaths of key figures at convenient moments warrant scrutiny

# Unit 4b - The English Civil War

## The English Civil War

### Origins of the Conflict

In 1642, thousands of Englishmen went to war. They weren't fighting foreign enemies like the French or Spanish, but instead were at war with themselves! This conflict is known as a **civil war**. What caused the two sides to turn against each other and how did it end?

On one side were King Charles I (James I's son) and his followers, known as **Royalists**. On the other side were the men of Parliament and their followers, known as **Parliamentarians**. For years, the English Parliament had worked with the monarch to make laws, raise taxes and discuss wars; now, they were at war **with** their king. Charles I (and his father James I) had argued with Parliament and believed their purpose was to serve the monarchy. Parliament, however, saw their role very differently.

### Opposing Viewpoints in 1642

Various people in England held different opinions about the conflict:

- **King Charles I:** "I am the king and I can do as I like. This is my divine right because God has appointed me. Parliament thinks I can't control the king by keeping much of my money. Parliament must be stopped... even if it means war."

- **William Cavendish, a rich lord:** "If Charles needs money, Parliament must get it for him. He is their king and God has put him on the throne. Parliament mustn't allow a king to act like a king. But Parliament doesn't give Charles enough money and even ordered the execution of two of his personal advisors! Parliament must be stopped... even if it means war."

- **John Hampden, a Member of Parliament:** "Running the country is a difficult job and Parliament has been helping kings and queens for years. We like helping to make decisions but Charles only uses us to collect taxes for him. When we refused to get him any more money, he sent us all home for 11 years and ruled without us. He only called us back because a Scottish army marched south and he needed money to raise an army. The reason they invaded was Charles' fault too because he'd told the Scots to use a new prayer book they didn't like. Charles must change his ways... even if it means war."

- **Harry Vane, a Puritan:** "I believe in a religion that's more 'pure'. We want Christianity and our government to be 'purified' of any remaining Catholic practices. It sounds strange, but the most important power in this country now is Parliament, not Charles. Catholics everywhere, including Charles' wife Henrietta Maria, are trying to make England Catholic. We must stop them... even if it means war."

- **Laura Kibble, a farm worker:** "I work very hard to make a good living, but Charles keeps taxing me and making me most recent taxes were a 'ship tax' even though I live inland near the sea. He calls it a ship tax. Charles might be king but taxes must be fair."

- **Nicholas Farrell, a merchant:** "I will have to fight for whichever side the landowner I rent from tells me to. He's appointed by God and I don't want to go against him. But if I have to fight, it is against Charles, they might kill me. They think he deserves it. Even if it means war."

### Escalation to War

The final straw came when Parliament sent Charles a long list of complaints against him. Furious, Charles sent 300 soldiers to London to arrest the 5 most troublesome MPs, but they had escaped. Charles left London to raise his army in the north, while the Queen (Henrietta Maria from France) headed to the Netherlands to sell the Crown Jewels to pay for the war! Meanwhile, Parliament started getting their army together. England was on the **brink of war**.

## The Battle Lines Form

### Match of the Day: Roundheads V Cavaliers

The Royalists were known as **Cavaliers**. Cavalier comes from the Italian word 'cavallo' meaning horse or horseback. The Cavaliers were known for their long hair and stylish clothes.

The Parliamentarians were nicknamed **Roundheads** because of their simple, short bowl-cut hairstyles.

On 22nd August 1642, King Charles I gathered his army in a field near Nottingham and struck his Royal Standard (a big flag) into the ground, declaring the official start of the Civil War. But who would dare to fight their King, and how did the two sides match up?

### Military Forces

Both armies had similar components:

- **Cavalry**: Rich men on horseback wearing steel breastplates and leather coats
- **Infantry**: Ordinary pikemen or musketeers on foot

**Armoured pikemen** stood at the front with 5m poles tipped with steel which they dug into the ground. **Musketeers** carried a big clumsy gun lit by burning rope and gunpowder. Hopefully it fired a ball up to 400m but was slow, complicated and dangerous!

### Historical Analysis

The English Civil War might have been avoided through different decisions:

- The King could have ruled collaboratively with Parliament and given them some decision-making power
- King Charles bears significant responsibility for the conflict because he failed to understand Parliament's role and treated them poorly
- Charles strongly believed in the Divine Right of Kings and refused to compromise

The conflict represented a fundamental disagreement about governance - whether ultimate power should rest with the monarch or be shared with Parliament, setting the stage for Britain's constitutional development.

### Civil affairs

People didn't actually choose the side they fought for. It often depended on which army reached their town or village first, or the side their local landowner supported. Different parts of the family could be on different sides.

### Cavaliers / The Roundheads
The Cavaliers were rich lords and country gentlemen along North and South-West England and Wales. They wore red sashes.

The Roundheads were merchants, businessmen and Puritans
