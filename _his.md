# The Spanish Armada

## Background

During the Tudor period, Spain was the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world. It possessed an enormous army, and Spanish ships transported vast fortunes in gold from newly discovered territories back to Spain. In 1588, Spain's King Phillip I directed his country's resources toward a single objective: the invasion of England. He commissioned every shipyard in Spain to construct what many described as the greatest navy—or Armada—ever created. This massive fleet of 130 large warships was destined for England.

## Causes of Spanish-English Conflict

### Reasons for King Phillip's Animosity Toward Elizabeth I

- In April 1587, Sir Francis Drake, England's most renowned explorer, sailed into Cadiz harbor and destroyed 30 of Spain's royal warships
- English sailors had been routinely plundering gold and silver from Spanish ships at sea for years
- When Phillip (a Catholic) learned that Elizabeth had executed Mary Queen of Scots (also Catholic), he believed Elizabeth deserved punishment
- The Spanish Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) was under Spanish control, but recent revolts against Spanish rule had received English support
- Phillip had previously been married to Mary Tudor (known as "Bloody Mary," Elizabeth's half-sister), and after her death, he proposed marriage to Elizabeth, who rejected him—publicly embarrassing Phillip

### Historical Context

It appears Phillip had multiple substantial grievances against England. The destruction of his royal fleet was particularly significant, as was England's interference in Spanish territories and Elizabeth's execution of a Catholic monarch.

### Strategic Implications

Following any successful invasion, Phillip would likely attempt to restore Catholicism in England, given his strong Catholic beliefs and opposition to Elizabeth's Protestant rule.

### Overview
By the summer of 1588, King Phillip had assembled one of history's greatest naval fleets. The Spanish Armada consisted of 130 galleon ships painted in red and gold, covering approximately 12 square kilometers at sea as they headed toward England. Their strategy involved meeting with 20,000 ground troops at Calais in northern France before crossing the English Channel to depose Elizabeth and install Phillip as England's ruler.

### Naval Forces Comparison

#### Spanish Forces: "The Ropers and Raiders"
- **Ships**: 130 galleons
- **Ship Length**: Approximately 50 meters
- **Mobility**: Clumsy to steer
- **Sailors**: Numerous experienced sailors
- **Weapons**: Heavy guns for close combat
- **Commander Ability**: Less experienced naval commanders

Spanish galleons functioned like enormous floating castles but were difficult to maneuver. Their battle strategy relied on sailing alongside enemy vessels and securing them with ropes and hooks. Spanish soldiers would then board the enemy ships to engage in close combat using swords, daggers, and muskets. Below deck, heavy guns positioned near the enemy ships would blast holes in their hulls.

#### English Forces: "The Speedy Smashers"
- **Ships**: Approximately 130 ships, with only 60 combat-ready
- **Ship Length**: Approximately 25 meters (half the Spanish length)
- **Mobility**: Much quicker
- **Sailors**: Highly experienced naval crews
- **Weapons**: Superior long-range artillery
- **Commander Ability**: Highly skilled naval commanders

The English vessels, though smaller, had superior maneuverability. They possessed two critical advantages: exceptionally accurate long-range artillery and standardized cannonball sizes across their fleet. The Spanish ships utilized various gun sizes and types, creating logistical challenges during battle.

### Battle Strategies

The English planned to maintain a distance of 150 meters from Spanish ships, leveraging their superior artillery to fire 20kg cannonballs through enemy vessel hulls. Smaller "man killer" cannons would then target sailors with 8kg projectiles. Once Spanish ships were damaged and their crews weakened, English forces would board to complete the victory.

### Strategic Assessment

The English naval strategy appeared better suited to exploit their advantages in mobility and weaponry. Their standardized ammunition system offered operational efficiency while their superior maneuverability allowed them to dictate engagement terms. The Spanish approach required close-quarter combat that depended on successfully approaching and boarding English vessels—a challenging prospect given their mobility disadvantage.

### The Battle Unfolds

1. The Spanish Armada sailed in a defensive crescent formation designed to resist English attacks
2. On July 29, the Armada was spotted off Cornwall, prompting warning beacons across hilltops to alert the population about the potential invasion
3. The English Navy pursued the Spanish fleet for over a week but initially failed to sink any Spanish vessels
4. By August 6, the Spanish had reached Calais, France, where they awaited their ground troops, who were delayed
5. Sir Francis Drake deployed fireships—old vessels filled with straw, gunpowder, tar, and barrels of pig fat set ablaze—against the Spanish fleet
6. Panicked by the fireships, the Spanish formation scattered across the North Sea, leaving individual ships vulnerable to repeated English attacks
7. The Spanish attempted to flee but encountered a violent storm while navigating around Scotland and Ireland

### Aftermath

Nearly every Spanish ship sustained damage during their retreat. Sailors faced starvation as provisions spoiled, and wounded men succumbed to infections. Those who managed to reach Scottish or Irish shores often faced hostile locals.

### Queen Elizabeth's Leadership

During this crisis, Queen Elizabeth I delivered one of Britain's most memorable speeches to her troops on August 18, 1588. Dressed in white and silver and mounted on a white horse, she declared: "I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and a King of England too, and think foul scorn that... Spain... should dare invade the border of my realm."

### Reasons for English Success

- Leadership from Sir Francis Drake
- Faster English ships
- The skill of English men
- Sleeker ships
- Greater skill of commanders
- Use of fireships caused panic
- Prior warning from spies
- More well thought out tactics
- Weather conditionx favoured the English
### Reasons for Spanish Failure

Several factors contributed to the Armada's defeat:
- Delayed Spanish ground forces undermined the invasion plan
- Inferior ship mobility compared to English vessels
- Tactical errors including breaking formation when confronted with fireships
- Lack of contingency plans when the original strategy failed
- Severe weather conditions during the retreat

## Source Work Practice - The Spanish Armada (14 marks)

### Primary Sources

#### Source A - King Philip II, talking to survivors of the Armada (1588)
"I sent you to fight with men, and not the weather. What happened in the English Channel is a disgrace to Spain, but we will have our revenge against that barbaric and godless nation. Elizabeth's forces are no match for our great Armada. Her reign shall be no more."

#### Source B - Inscription on the Armada medal issued by Elizabeth I (1588)
"God blew with His wind, and they were scattered."

### Source Analysis Questions

#### Question 1: Source A Analysis
Philip II blamed the defeat of the Armada on the weather and expressed disappointment with his men's performance.

#### Question 2: Source Connection
Both sources reference weather as a factor in the Armada's defeat and make religious references, with each side claiming divine favor.

#### Question 3: Religious Significance
Religion played a crucial role in the Spanish Armada conflict. Source A shows Philip II referring to England as a "godless nation," while Source B attributes the Spanish defeat to divine intervention with "God blew with His wind." Beyond these sources, religious tensions formed the foundation of the conflict. Philip, a devout Catholic, considered it his duty to restore Catholicism to Protestant England. Elizabeth's execution of Mary Queen of Scots, a Catholic, further inflamed religious hostilities. Both sides viewed the battle not merely as a military conflict but as a divine judgment on their respective faiths.

#### Question 4: Source A Usefulness Analysis (MADCL Technique)

##### Mode
The source is a conversation between King Philip II and Armada survivors, making it valuable as a direct exchange between the Spanish monarch and participants in the event.

##### Author
King Philip II of Spain ordered the attack on England, giving him significant authority on the Spanish perspective, though his position also introduces bias.

##### Date
Created in 1588 shortly after the Armada's defeat, the source provides contemporary reactions to the event.

##### Content
The source reveals Philip's attribution of blame ("I sent you to fight with men, not the weather"), his animosity toward England ("barbaric and godless nation"), and his continued hostility ("we will have our revenge").

##### Limitations
The source presents only the Spanish perspective and shows clear bias against England. Philip II wasn't personally present during the battle, limiting his firsthand knowledge of events.

#### Conclusion on Source Usefulness
Source A provides valuable insight into the Spanish monarchy's official reaction to the defeat and reveals the continuing hostility toward England. While limited by Philip's bias and absence from the actual battle, it remains a useful primary source for understanding Spanish perspectives on the Armada's failure and the religious dimensions of the conflict.
